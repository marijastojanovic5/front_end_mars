             <p>Lunar distance (LD), also called Earthâ€“Moon distance,
                  or distance to the Moon, is a unit of measure in 
                  astronomy. It is the average distance from the center 
                  of Earth to the center of the Moon. Below we have  
                  close-approach data (asteroid or comet) within 10 Lunar distances
                   on or after 2018-Jan-01 sorted by distance. One Lunar distance, for example is 238,856 miles. An AU is 389 Lunar distances. </p>
